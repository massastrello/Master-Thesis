Accurate and robust control of robots in highly dynamic tasks is arguably is one the hardest open problems in robotics. The incapability of robots to interact with their environment in a safe and reliable manner is what still refrain them from becoming ubiquitous in our society.

This issue in robotics is a fundamental control challenge which attracts great interest among practitioners, since industry is seeking more autonomy of their robots.
}

Howbeit, this interest expands swiftly to a theoretical level once the
problem is formalized. Discontinuities of any sort used to be sworn enemies of most control theorists. However, in recente

 Mathematical tools coming from different fields can be used
to provide an insight to the output regulation problem in different ways.
An important control technique that is classically used to achieve periodic output regulation si called Repetitive Control (RC) and this thesis focuses on (but is not
limited to) the development and the analysis with novel tools of RC schemes.
Periodic output regulation for nonlinear dynamical systems is a challenging topic.
This thesis, besides of providing consistent and practically useful results in the linear
case, introduces promising tools dealing with the nonlinear periodic output regulation problem, whose solution is presented for particular classes of systems.
The contribution of this research is mainly theoretical and relies on the use of
mathematical tools like infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems and autonomous
discrete-time systems to study stability and tracking properties in RC schemes and periodic regulation in general. Differently from the classical continuous-time formulation of RC, internal model arguments are not directly used is this work to study
asymptotic tracking. In this way the linear case can be reinterpreted under a new
light and novel strategies to consistently attack the nonlinear case are presented.
Furthermore an application-oriented chapter with experimental results is present
which describes the possibility of implementing a discrete-time RC scheme involving trajectory generation and non-minimum phase systems.
%Accurate localization and mapping are very important for mobile robots working in indoor environments where human exists. In order to localize and map accurately, a rangefinder (LRF) is widely used because of it high accuracy in distance measuring. In modern indoor environments, glass is very common. However, glass is usually not shown on the map correctly when using LRF, because it cannot be detected by LRF from all angles, as other objects. The incorrect map brings the danger of crashing into the glass to the mobile robot when path planning. Furthermore, the limited ability of LRF in glass detection negatively influences the localization accuracy of the mobile robots. 
%
%To solve the problems mentioned above, this thesis proposes to build a glass confidence map which can show all objects on the map, glass included, and their probability of being glass. The purpose of this thesis is to build such a glass confidence map. The method proposed is to first classify glass and non-glass objects, and then process them differently in order to get a better map. 
%
%%The reason glass need to be processed differently is because in standard mapping stage, objects are assumed to be detectable from all incident angles, while glass does not match this assumption. 
%
%To classify the glass and non-glass objects, a neural network based classifier is proposed, with LRF's measured intensities, distances and incident angles as inputs, as well as glass probability as output. The classification method is based on the assumption proposed in this thesis, that the LRF's measured intensity is mainly influenced by material features, incident angle and distance, and therefore material features can be inferred by LRF intensity, distance and incident angle. To verified the assumption, experiments are performed, and the results show glass and non-glass panels have obviously different patterns and are separable in the feature space of intensity, distance and incident angle. The proposed neural network classifier has 2 hidden layers, 10 nodes in each hidden layer, and is trained and tested using experimental data. 
%
%Additionally, a novel map building method is proposed to build the targeted glass confidence map using the glass probability and information from standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). First, the glass probability is registered to a temporary map, using a Gaussian Filter to reduce the influence of uncertainty in robot pose and LRF measurements. Second, to remove noise, the temporary map is filtered based on both occupancy probability and glass probability. Glass objects are applied to a lower occupancy threshold than non-glass objects, considering the fact glass cannot be detected consistently by the LRF.
%
%To verify the proposed method, two experiments in two different environments are performed. As a result, glass confidence maps are built, with more glass shown correctly than maps built by standard methods. Besides, quantitative analysis on the results shows that the neural network classifier classify glass and non-glass objects with high accuracy. In summary, the proposed method can build glass confidence maps successfully and accurately.
