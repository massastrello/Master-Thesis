\section{Conclusion}
Future work will include an additional formalization of the framework of \textit{hybrid port--Hamiltonian} systems, e.g. well--posedness, Lyapunov theory etc., and the exploration of the stabilization properties of the {iterative energy shaping} controllers for general hybrid systems.
%\clearpage

Future work will include investigations of the theoretical aspects linked to the multistable controller, the shaping of the basins of attraction and the stability of the overall hybrid system. A real implementation of the control system will also be explored.
