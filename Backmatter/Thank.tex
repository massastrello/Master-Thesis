Now that I am writing the last few words of this thesis, I would like to thank all the people who contributed, in different ways, to this big achievement. 

First, I would like to thank my supervisor \textbf{Professor Hajime Asama} who made me part of his group and always guided me, teaching me how research works. His honest and sincere advice has been extremely important throughout all the path who lead me to this final result. Nevertheless, at a personal level, I want to express my outmost gratitude towards his to be my mentor and inspiration.

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the reviewers of my thesis, \textbf{Professor Hideki Kawakatsu} and \textbf{Lecturer Shunsuke Yoshimoto}. Their experience brought me insightful and keen suggestions which certainly helped in improving the quality of this thesis. Thank you very much, in advance.

Special thanks also to \textbf{Assaciate Professor Atsushi Yamashita} whose hardworking attitude and devotion to research gave me unvaluable teaching. Moreover, his timely, focused and objective advice always helped me taking the right direction at every turn. 

Although words are probably not enough, I have to extend my deepest gratitude to \textbf{Project Assistant Professor Angela Faragasso} for supervising me throughout all my Master course. I thank her for her patience, sincerity and friendship. 

In the same way, I would like to spend few words for \textbf{Dr. Federico Califano}, from the University of Twente. He has been my bachelor thesis supervisor in Bologna University and, since then, we became friends, starting a collaboration which certainly has been fundamental to the development of this thesis. His theoretical, yet insightful approach thought me a lot on how to output good research.

I would also like to extend my thanks to everyone at the Asama-Yamashita lab. In particular, to  \textbf{Project Associate Professor Yusuke Tamura}, \textbf{Assistant Professor Qi An}, \textbf{Project Assistant Professor Shota Chikushi}, \textbf{Technical Specialist Dr. Hiroshi Yamakawa}, \textbf{Visiting Researcher Dr. Alessandro Moro}, \textbf{JSPS Post Doctoral Research Sarthak Pathak} and all the students who form the wonderful team of staff at the Asama and Yamashita laboratories, and all other lab members for their constant support and academic/non-academic discussions.

Thanks also to \textbf{Ms. Maki Ishida}, \textbf{Ms. Negumi Nakamura} and special thanks to \textbf{Hisae Narushima} for always helping me, and everyone at the laboratory, in all administrative matters. 

Outside academia, I would like to thank all my family and friends who unconditionally supported me in every step of this path.
